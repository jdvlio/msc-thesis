\section{Model theory and logic}

Our primitive (logical) symbols are $\bot$, $\rightarrow$, $\wedge$ and $\exists$ with their usual semantics.  We will also make use of the following symbols to abbreviate certain formulas in the way one would normally expect in (classical) first-order logic: $\top$, $\neg$, $\vee$ and $\forall$.  Since there is more than one way to do this

On occasion we might encounter infinite conjunctions and disjuctions by employing the (respective) symbols $\bigwedge$ and $\bigvee$, with or without subscripts.  These do not occur in the language of first-order logic as such but rather in its infinitary extensions $L_{\kappa\omega}$ with $\kappa$ an initial ordinal and $L$ ranging over all possible signatures.  For a fixed signature $L$ the notation $L_{\infty\omega}$ is also encountered in the literature to denote the (smallest) language containg $L_{\kappa\omega}$, for each initial ordinal $\kappa$.  An example of a minimalistic but infinitary extension of a first-order language would be the language $L_{\omega_1\omega}$ which also allows formulas to have denumerable conjunctions and disjunctions such as in $\bigvee_{i<\omega}\bigwedge_{j<\omega}\varphi_{ij}$.

\begin{conv}[Signatures and languages]
	We will make a habit of identifying the language $L_{\omega\omega}$ (the first-order language over the signature $L$) with its underlying signature as these uniquely determine each other.
\end{conv}

\begin{conv}
	We indentify any language $L_{\kappa\omega}$ with its corresponding set of formulas, allowing us to make assertions such as ``$\varphi\in L$'' in the case $L=L_{\omega\omega}$.
\end{conv}

\begin{dfn}[Finitary languages]
	A language $L$ is called \textbf{finitary} if $L$ is a language over a finite signature.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prp}\label{prp:finequiv}
	Suppose we fix any $n\in\nats$ and $L$ is a finitary first order language. If $v_0,\dotsc,v_{k-1}$ are distinct variables then, up to logical equivalence, there are only finitely many formulas $\varphi=\varphi(v_1,\dotsc,v_{k-1})$ such that $\qrank(\varphi)\leq n$.
\end{prp}

\begin{dfn}[Characteristic formulas]
	If $L$ is some finitary language, $\mathfrak{M}$ is some $L$-structure and $\bar{a}\in\domain{k}{\mathfrak{M}}$ then we define the \textbf{$\mathbf{n}$-characterstic formula} $\cha{\bar{a}}{n}$ of $\bar{a}$ relative to $\mathfrak{M}$, recursively, as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\cha{\bar{a}}{0}=\bigwedge\setbuild{\varphi(\bar{x})\in L_k}{\mathfrak{M}\models\varphi(\bar{a})}$;
		\item $\cha{\bar{a}}{n+1}=\bigwedge_{b\in\domain{}\mathfrak{M}}\exists v_n \cha{\bar{a}b}{n}\wedge\forall v_n\bigvee_{b\in\domain{}\mathfrak{M}}\cha{\bar{a}b}{n}$, for each $n\in\nats$.
	\end{enumerate}
	If $\bar{a}$ is the empty tuple, and $n\in\nats$, then we write $\cha{\mathfrak{M}}{n}$ for $\cha{\bar{a}}{n}$ and call $\cha{\mathfrak{M}}{n}$ the \textit{$\mathit{n}$-characteristic sentence} of the structure $\mathfrak{M}$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prp}
	If $L_{\omega\omega}$ is a finitary language, $\mathfrak{M}$ is an $L$-structure and $n\in\nats$ then the $L_{\omega_1\omega}$-sentence $\cha{\mathfrak{M}}{n}$ is logically equivalent to an $L_{\omega\omega}$-sentence $\sigma$.
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	From proposition \ref{prp:finequiv} it follows that there exists sentences $\sigma_0,\dotsc,\sigma_{k-1}$, of quantifier rank at most $n$, such that for every sentence $\sigma\in\Th(\mathfrak{M})$ it holds that $\qrank(\sigma)\leq n$ implies that $\sigma$ is logically equivalent to exactly one of $\sigma_0,\dotsc,\sigma_{k-1}$.  Without loss of generality we may assume that $\mathfrak{M}\models\sigma_i$ for $i=0,\dotsc,k-1$ as we could otherwise simply discard sentences false in $\mathfrak{M}$. By definition of a characteristic sentence, it then follows that $\cha{\mathfrak{M}}{n}$ is logically equivalent to $\sigma=\bigwedge_{0\leq i<k_0}\sigma_i$, which is the required sentence.
\end{proof}

In light of the previous proposition, when $L$ is a finitary first-order language and $n\in\nats$, for a class $\mathcal{S}$ of $L$-structures we will identify the $L_{\omega_1\omega}$-sentences $\bigvee_{\alpha\in\mathcal{S}}\cha{\alpha}{n}$ and $\bigwedge_{\alpha\in\mathcal{S}}\cha{\alpha}{n}$ with any of their respective first-order equivalents.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:diagH}
	Suppose $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are $L$-structures.  If $\bar{c}$ is a (possibly infinite) tuple of constant symbols and $\bar{a}\in A^{\ell(\bar{c})}$ and $\bar{b}\in B^{\ell(\bar{c})}$ then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	for every atomic $\sigma\in L_0(\bar{c})$, if $(\mathfrak{A},\bar{a})\models\sigma$ then $(\mathfrak{B},\bar{b})\models\sigma$,
		\item  there exists a homomorphism $h\colon\gen{\bar{a}}{\mathfrak{A}}\to\mathfrak{B}$ such that $f[\bar{a}]=f[\bar{b}]$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Additionally, if $h$ exists then it is unique and, furthermore, $h$ is an embedding iff $(\mathfrak{A},\bar{a})\nequiv{0}(\mathfrak{B},\bar{b})$.
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}[Positive Diagram Lemma]\label{lem:diagp}
	Suppose $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are $L$-structures.  If $f$ is a map $f\colon A\to B$ then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$h$ is a homomorphism $h\colon\mathfrak{A}\to\mathfrak{B}$,
		\item	for each $n\in\nats$ and every atomic formula $\varphi\in L_n$ it holds that, whenever $\bar{a}\in A^n$,
			\begin{equation}
				\mathfrak{A}\models\varphi(\bar{a}) \quad\implies\quad \mathfrak{B}\models\varphi(h[\bar{a}])
			\end{equation}
		\item	it holds that $(\mathfrak{B},h[A])\models\diagp\mathfrak{A}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}[Diagram Lemma]\label{lem:diag}
	Suppose $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are $L$-structures.  If $f$ is a map $f\colon A\to B$ then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$h$ is an embedding $h\colon\mathfrak{A}\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{B}$,
		\item	for each $n\in\nats$ and every quantifier-free formula $\varphi\in L_n$ it holds that, whenever $\bar{a}\in A^n$,
			\begin{equation}
				\mathfrak{A}\models\varphi(\bar{a}) \quad\iff\quad \mathfrak{B}\models\varphi(h[\bar{a}])
			\end{equation}
		\item	it holds that that $(\mathfrak{B},h[A])\models\diag\mathfrak{A}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{dfn}[Quantifier elimination]
	An $L$-theory $T$ is said to \textbf{admit quantifier elimination} (or \textit{has} quantifier elimination) if for every $k\in\nats$ and every $\varphi\in L_k$ there exists a quantifier-free formula $\psi\in L_k$ such that $\varphi$ is $T$-equivalent (or equivalent modulo $T$) to $\psi$ i.e.\ $T\models\forall\bar{x}(\varphi(\bar{x})\leftrightarrow\psi(\bar{x}))$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Substructure-completeness]
	A first-order theory $T$, in some language $L$, is said to be \textbf{substructure-complete} whenever for every model $\mathfrak{M}$ of $T$ and every substructure $\mathfrak{A}$ of $\mathfrak{M}$ it necessarily holds that $T\cup\diag(\mathfrak{A})$ is a complete $L(A)$-theory.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Literal]
	A formula $\varphi\in L$ is called a \textbf{literal} whenever it is either an atomic $L$-formula or, otherwise, the negation of such an atomic formula.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Simply primitive]
	A formula $\varphi(\bar{x})\in L_n$, for some $n\in\posnats$, is said to be \textbf{simply primitive} whenever there exists literals $\varphi_0(\bar{x},y),\dotsc,\varphi_{n-1}(\bar{x},y)\in L_n$ such that $\varphi(\bar{x})=\exists y\bigwedge_{0\leq i<n}\varphi_i(\bar{x},y)$.  We denote the class of simply primitive formulas as $\E{}^\ast$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prp}\label{prp:sprm}
	An $L$-theory $T$ admits quantifier elimination iff every simply primitive $L$-formula is $T$-equivalent to a quantifier-free formula.
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	\forward Trivial.

	\backward We argue on the complexity of the formula $\varphi\in L$ that it is $T$-equivalent to a quantifier-free formula.  If $\varphi$ is atomic then it trivially follows that $\varphi$ is quantifier-free.  Note $\bot$ is quantifier-free as it is atomic and suppose now that $\varphi_0$ and $\varphi_1$ are, respectively, $T$-equivalent to quantifier-free formulas $\psi_0,\psi_1\in L$.  It follows  by definition that the formulas $\varphi_0\rightarrow\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_0\wedge\varphi_1$ are $T$-equivalent to the respective quantifier-free formulas $\psi_0\rightarrow\psi_1$ and $\psi_0\wedge\psi_1$.  Lastly, note that $\exists y\varphi_0$, by the induction hypothesis, is $T$-equivalent to the simply primitive formula $\exists y\psi_0$.  As simply primitive $L$-formulas (by assumption) are $T$-equivalent to quantifier-free formulas, we may conclude that $\exists y\psi_0$, and thus $\exists y\varphi_0$, is $T$-equivalent to a quantifier-free formula.
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}[Boolean closure]
	If $\Phi\subseteq L$ is a set of $L$-formulas then its \textbf{boolean closure} (denoted as $\widetilde{\Phi}$) is the smallest set of $L$-formulas such that $\widetilde{\Phi}\supseteq\Phi\cup\set{\bot,\top}$ and is closed under negation, conjunction and disjunction i.e.\ if $\varphi,\psi\in\widetilde{\Phi}$ then it must follow that $\set{\neg\varphi, \varphi\wedge\psi,\varphi\vee\psi}\subseteq\widetilde{\Phi}$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{rem}
	Note in the definition of a boolean closure that the condition that $\widetilde{\Phi}$ be closed under disjunctions is redundant.
\end{rem}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:bcls}
	Let $T$ be an $L$-theory and fix some $\sigma\in L_0$.  If $\Sigma$ is an $L$-theory then $\sigma$ is $T$-equivalent to a sentence from $\widetilde{\Sigma}$ iff it holds for every $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$ that:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{M}\equiv_\Sigma\mathfrak{N} \quad\implies\quad \mathfrak{M}\equiv_\sigma\mathfrak{N}
	\end{equation}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	\forward  Note that no generality is lost by assuming that $\sigma\in\widetilde{\Sigma}$.  As the case $\sigma\in\set{\bot,\top}$ is trivial, suppose not.  We argue by induction on the complexity of $\sigma$.  If $\sigma\in\Sigma$ then it follows by definition that $\mathfrak{M}\equiv_\Sigma\mathfrak{N}$.  Assume now that $\sigma_0,\sigma_1\in\widetilde{\Sigma}$ and either $\sigma=\neg\sigma_0$, $\sigma=\sigma_0\wedge\sigma_1$, where (for $i=0,1$) it holds, for $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$, that
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{M}\equiv_\Sigma\mathfrak{N} \quad\implies\quad \mathfrak{M}\equiv_{\sigma_i}\mathfrak{N}.
	\end{equation}
	In both cases it necessarily then follows from the usual definition of Tarski semantics that, for $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$, we must have
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{M}\equiv_\Sigma\mathfrak{N} \quad\implies\quad \mathfrak{M}\equiv_\sigma\mathfrak{N}.
	\end{equation}

	\backward  Consider the set $S_L$ of complete $L$-theories, under its usual Stone topology, and define the sets $S=\gen{\sigma}{}\cap\bigcap_{\sigma^\prime\in T}\gen{\sigma^\prime}{}$ and $S^\prime=\gen{\neg\sigma}{}\cap\bigcap_{\sigma^\prime\in T}\gen{\sigma^\prime}{}$.  Note, if $T\cup\set{\sigma}$ is inconsistent then it follows that $T\models\neg\sigma$ and thus $\sigma$ is $T$-equivalent to $\bot$ so that the result follows trivially.  Similarly,  if $T\cup\set{\neg\Sigma}$ is inconsistent then $\sigma$ is $T$-equivalent to $\top$ and the result again follows trivially.  Now assume both $T\cup\set{\sigma}$ and $T\cup\set{\neg\sigma}$ are consistent so that $S\neq\emptyset\neq S^\prime$.

	Note now that, for every $T_0\in S$ and $T_1\in S^\prime$, it follows our assumption (by contraposition) that if $\mathfrak{M}_0\models T_0$ and $\mathfrak{M}_1\models T_1$ then there exists a $\sigma_{T_0,T_1}\in\Sigma$ such that $\mathfrak{M}_0\models\sigma_{T_0,T_1}$ but $\mathfrak{M}_1\models\neg\sigma_{T_0,T_1}$.  Note that, for every $T_0\in S$, the set $\setbuild{\gen{\neg\sigma_{T_0,T^\prime}}{}}{{T^\prime\in S^\prime}}$ is an open cover of $S^\prime$.  Since $S^\prime$ is an intersection of closed sets, it now follows that $S^\prime$ itself is closed and therefore must be compact as it is a closed subset of the compact topological space $S_L$.  By definition of compactness, there must then exist $T^\prime_0,\dotsc,T^\prime_{k-1}\in S^\prime$ (for some $k\in\posnats$) such that the set $\set{\gen{\neg\sigma_{T_0,T^\prime_0}}{},\dotsc,\gen{\neg\sigma_{T_0,T^\prime_{k-1}}}{}}$ is an open cover of $S^\prime$.  We may now conclude that
	\begin{equation}
		T\cup\set{\neg\sigma}\models\bigvee_{i<k}\neg\sigma_{T_0,T^\prime_i},
	\end{equation}
	and therefore
	\begin{equation}
		T\models\neg\sigma\rightarrow\bigvee_{i<k}\neg\sigma_{T_0,T^\prime_i}.\label{eq:tmnsr}
	\end{equation}
	Now, for each $T_0\in S$, define $\sigma_{T_0}=\bigwedge_{i<k}\sigma_{T_0,T^\prime_i}$ and note that $\sigma_{T_0}\in\widetilde{\Sigma}$ as it is a conjunction of sentences from $\Sigma\subseteq\widetilde{\Sigma}$.  Note also, by contraposition, that
	\begin{equation}
		T\models\sigma_{T_0}\rightarrow\sigma.
	\end{equation}
	Note now for every $T_0\in S$, and each natural $i<k$, that we necessarily have $T_0\models\sigma_{T_0,T_i^\prime}$.  Consequently $T_0\models\sigma_{T_0}$, for each $T_0\in S$, and therefore the set $\setbuild{\gen{\sigma_{T_0}}{}}{T_0\in S}$ is an open cover of $S$.  Since $S$ is a closed, and therefore compact, subset of $S_L$ it follows that there exists a finite subcover $\set{\gen{\sigma_{T^\pprime_0}}{},\dotsc,\gen{\sigma_{T^\pprime_{m-1}}}{}}$ of the aforementioned open cover.  Consequently,
	\begin{equation}
		T\cup\set{\sigma}\models\bigvee_{i<m}\sigma_{T^\pprime_i}.
	\end{equation}
	We may now assume, without loss of generality, it holds that $T\cup\set{\sigma}\models\sigma_{T^\pprime_0}$ and therefore
	\begin{equation}
		T\models\sigma\rightarrow\sigma_{T^\pprime_0}.
	\end{equation}
	Since it has already been determined that $T\models\sigma_{T_0^\pprime}\rightarrow\sigma$ and it holds that $\sigma_{T^\pprime_0}\in\widetilde{\Sigma}$, the result then follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{prp}\label{prp:bcls}
	Let $T$ be an $L$-theory and, for any $n\in\nats$, fix some $\varphi\in L_n$.  If $\Delta\subseteq L_n$ then $\varphi$ is $T$-equivalent to a formula from $\widetilde{\Delta}$ iff the following holds for every $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$ and each $\bar{a}\in M^n$ and $\bar{b}\in N^n$:
	\begin{equation}
		 \mathfrak{M}\models\delta(\bar{a})\text{ iff }\mathfrak{N}\models\delta(\bar{b})\text{, for all $\delta\in\Delta$,} \implies \mathfrak{M}\models\varphi(\bar{a})\text{ iff }\mathfrak{N}\models\varphi(\bar{b}).
	\end{equation}
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	Let $n\in\nats$ and suppose that $\varphi=\varphi(\bar{x})\in L_n$ and $\Delta=\Delta(\bar{x})\subseteq L_n$.  Consider now a tuple $\bar{c}$ of constant symbols which is of length $n$.  After convincing oneself that $\widetilde{\Delta(\bar{c})}=\widetilde{\Delta}(\bar{c})$, that is to say that the operation of taking a boolean closure of a set of formulas and that of substition by constant symbols commute, it follows from lemma \ref{lem:bcls} that $\varphi(\bar{c})$ is equivalent to a sentence from $\widetilde{\Delta}(\bar{c})$ iff
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{M}^\prime\equiv_{\Delta(\bar{c})}\mathfrak{N}^\prime \quad\implies\quad \mathfrak{M}^\prime\equiv_{\varphi(\bar{c})}\mathfrak{N}^\prime,
	\end{equation}
	for all $L(\bar{c})$-expansions $\mathfrak{M}^\prime$ and $\mathfrak{N}^\prime$ of the respective $L$-structures $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$.  Redressing this equivalence purely in terms of $L$-formulas and $L$-structures (by taking their $L$-reducts) then yields the desired result.
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}
	Recursively define the following classes of $L_{\infty\omega}$ formulas, with $L$ ranging over all signatures:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$\E{0}=\A{0}$ is the class of formulas $\varphi$ such that $\varphi$ is a quantifier-free formula in some first-order language $L$,
		\item	if $n\in\nats$, $\E{n+1}\supseteq\A{n}$ is defined to the smallest class of formulas, closed under $\bigwedge$ and $\bigvee$, such that $\exists\bar{x}\varphi\in\E{n+1}$ whenever $\bar{x}$ is finite tuple of variables and $\varphi\in\E{n+1}$,
		\item	if $n\in\nats$, $\A{n+1}\supseteq\E{n}$ is defined to be the smallest class of formulas, closed under $\bigwedge$ and $\bigvee$, such that $\forall\bar{x}\varphi\in\A{n+1}$ whenever $\bar{x}$ is finite tuple of variables and $\varphi\in\A{n+1}$.
	\end{enumerate}
	In particular, members of $\E{1}$ are known as the \textbf{existential formulas} while the members of $\A{1}$ are referred to as \textbf{universal formulas}.
\end{dfn}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:qelim}
	The following are equivalent for a consistent $L$-theory $T$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$T$ admits quantifier elimination,
		\item	$T$ is a substructure-complete theory,
		\item	if $\mathfrak{A}$ is finitely generated, $f\colon\mathfrak{A}\to\mathfrak{M}$ and $g\colon\mathfrak{A}\to\mathfrak{N}$ are embeddings and $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$ then, for every $n\in\nats$ and each simply primitive $\varphi\in L_n(A)$, it holds for every $\bar{a}\in A^n$ that
		\begin{equation}
			\mathfrak{M}\models\varphi(f[\bar{a}]) \quad\iff\quad \mathfrak{N}\models\varphi(g[\bar{a}]).\label{eq:qelim}
		\end{equation}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	1$\Rightarrow$2:  Choose any $\mathfrak{M}\models T$ and any $\mathfrak{A}\subseteq\mathfrak{M}$.  Note, since $T$ has quantifier elimination, it follows from the diagram lemma (choosing $h$ as the inclusion map) that
	\begin{equation}
		\Th(\mathfrak{M},A)\subseteq T\cup\diag\mathfrak{A}.
	\end{equation}
	Since the former is complete it immediately follows that the latter is complete as well.

	2$\Rightarrow$3:  Suppose $\mathfrak{A}$ is a finitely generated structure and let $f\colon\mathfrak{A}\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{M}$ and $g\colon\mathfrak{A}\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{N}$ be embeddings into the respective models $\mathfrak{M}$ and $\mathfrak{N}$ of $T$.  Without loss of generality we may assume $f$ and $g$ are inclusion maps and therefore $\mathfrak{A}\subseteq\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}$.  By assumption the $L(A)$-theory $T\cup\diag\mathfrak{A}$ is complete.  Therefore, since $(\mathfrak{M},A)\models T\cup\diag\mathfrak{A}$ and $(\mathfrak{N},A)\models T\cup\diag\mathfrak{A}$, it follows that $(\mathfrak{M},A)\equiv(\mathfrak{N},A)$.  By definition, this is equivalent to (\ref{eq:qelim}).

	3$\Rightarrow$1:  By Proposition \ref{prp:sprm}, it is enough to show that every simply primitive formula is $T$-equivalent to a quantifier-free formula.  In turn, Proposition \ref{prp:bcls} reduces this to showing, for each $n\in\nats$, that if $\bar{c}$ is an $n$-tuple of constant symbols and $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$ are $L$-structures then all of their (respective) $L(\bar{c})$-expansions $\mathfrak{M}^\prime$ and $\mathfrak{N}^\prime$ satisfy
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{M}^\prime\equiv_{\A{0}}\mathfrak{N}^\prime \quad\implies\quad \mathfrak{M}^\prime\equiv_{\E{}^\ast}\mathfrak{N}^\prime.
	\end{equation}

	Let $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$ be $L$-structures and choose, for an arbitrary $n\in\nats$, any $\bar{a}\in\domain{n}\mathfrak{M}$ and any $\bar{b}\in\domain{n}\mathfrak{N}$ such that
	\begin{equation}
		(\mathfrak{M},\bar{a})\equiv_{\A{0}}(\mathfrak{N},\bar{b}).
	\end{equation}
	Define the structures $\mathfrak{A}=\gen{\bar{a}}{\mathfrak{M}}$ and $\mathfrak{B}=\gen{\bar{b}}{\mathfrak{N}}$ and note, by definition, that both of them are finitely generated.  From lemma \ref{lem:diagH}, it follows that there exists an embedding $h\colon\mathfrak{A}\to\mathfrak{N}$ such that $h[\bar{a}]=h[\bar{b}]$.  Since $\mathfrak{B}$ is generated by $\bar{b}=h[\bar{a}]$, we may consider $h$ to be an isomorphism $h\colon\mathfrak{A}\to\mathfrak{B}$.  Therefore, we may identify the structures $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ so that the desired conlusion then follows from (3) by choosing $f$ and $g$ to be the respective inclusion maps $f\colon\mathfrak{A}\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{M}$ and $g\colon\mathfrak{A}\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{N}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}[Model-completeness]
	An $L$-theory $T$ is said to be \textbf{model-complete} if every embedding $f\colon\mathfrak{M}\to\mathfrak{N}$, between models $\mathfrak{M}$ and $\mathfrak{N}$ of $T$, is elementary.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prp}
	The following are equivalent for an $L$-theory $T$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$T$ is model-complete,
		\item	for all $\mathfrak{N}\models T$, if $\mathfrak{M}\subseteq\mathfrak{N}$ and $\mathfrak{M}\models T$ then $T\cup\diag(\mathfrak{M})$ is a complete $L(M)$-theory.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	1$\Rightarrow$2: Suppose $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$ and $\mathfrak{M}\subseteq\mathfrak{N}$.  Note now that for any $L(M)$-structure $\mathfrak{A}^\prime\models T\cup\diag(\mathfrak{M})$ if $\mathfrak{A}$ is the $L$-reduct of $\mathfrak{A}^\prime$ then there exists an embedding $h\colon\mathfrak{M}\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{A}$ such that $\mathfrak{A}^\prime=(\mathfrak{A},h[M])$.  From (1) it follows that $h$ is elementary and thus $(\mathfrak{M},M)\equiv\mathfrak{A}^\prime$.  Since $\mathfrak{A}^\prime$ was arbitrary it follows that any two models of $T\cup\diag(\mathfrak{M})$ will be elementarily equivalent to $(\mathfrak{M},M)$ and thus to each other.

	2$\Rightarrow$1:  Suppose $\mathfrak{M},\mathfrak{N}\models T$ and let $f\colon\mathfrak{M}\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{N}$ be an embedding.  We are now required to show that $f$ is elementary.  By the Elementary Diagram Lemma this amounts to showing that
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:mc2}
		(\mathfrak{N},f[M])\models\Th(\mathfrak{M},M).
	\end{equation}
	Noting that, since $f$ is an embedding, it follows from the Diagram Lemma that $(\mathfrak{N},f[M])\models T\cup\diag{\mathfrak{M}}$.  Also, since $(\mathfrak{M},M)\models T\cup\diag{\mathfrak{M}}$ and $T\cup\diag{\mathfrak{M}}$ is complete it follows that the deductive closure of $T\cup\diag{\mathfrak{M}}$ is the complete theory $\Th(\mathfrak{M},M)$.  As a consequence of these observations, (\ref{eq:mc2}) follows immediately.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:qemc}
	If $T$ is a first-order theory that admits quantifier elmination then $T$ is model-complete.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	Follows immediately from the definition of model-completeness and the implication (2)$\Rightarrow$(1) in the previous proposition.
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}[$n$-Type]
	Let $\mathfrak{A}$ be an $L$-structure and $n\in\nats$ while supposing, for some $A_0\subseteq A$, that $\Phi=\Phi(\bar{x})\subseteq L_n(A_0)$ is deductively closed and closed under finite conjunctions.  We call $\Phi$ an $\mathbf{n}$\textbf{-type of }$\bm{\mathfrak{A}}$\textbf{ over }$\bm{A_0}$ iff there exists some $\mathfrak{B}\succcurlyeq\mathfrak{A}$ and a $\bar{b}\in B^n$ such that $\mathfrak{B}\models\Phi(\bar{b})$ i.e.\ $\mathfrak{B}\models\varphi(\bar{b})$, for every $\varphi\in\Phi(\bar{x})$.  Additionally, if $A_0=\emptyset$ then $\Phi$ is also referred to as an $\mathbf{n}$\textbf{-type of the complete theory }$T=\Th(\mathfrak{A})$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Realisation]
	A tuple $\bar{b}$ of length $n$ in a structure $\mathfrak{B}\succcurlyeq\mathfrak{A}$ is said to \textbf{realise} a type $\Phi(\bar{x})\subseteq L_n(A)$ of a structure $\mathfrak{A}$ iff $\mathfrak{B}\models\Phi(\bar{b})$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Isolated and principal types]
	An $n$-type $\Phi(\bar{x})\subseteq L_n(A)$ of an $L$-structure $\mathfrak{A}$ is called \textbf{isolated} whenever there exists a formula $\varphi_0\in L_n(A)$, satisfiable in $\mathfrak{A}$, such that $(\mathfrak{A},A)\models\forall\bar{x}(\varphi_0(\bar{x})\rightarrow\varphi(\bar{x}))$, for each $\varphi\in\Phi(\bar{x})$.  If $\varphi_0$ can be chosen such that $\varphi_0\in\Phi(\bar{x})$ then $\Phi$ is also said to be \textbf{principal}.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Saturation]
	Given any infinite cardinal $\kappa$, an $L$-structure $\mathfrak{A}$ is called $\bm{\kappa}$\textbf{-saturated} whenever $\kappa\leq\card{\mathfrak{A}}$ and each $1$-type of $\mathfrak{A}$, over any $A_0\subseteq A$ such that $\card{A_0}<\kappa$, is realised by some element in $\mathfrak{A}$.  We call $\mathfrak{A}$ \textbf{saturated} iff it is $\card{\mathfrak{A}}$-saturated.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prp}\label{prp:sat0}
	If $\mathfrak{A}$ is an $\aleph_0$-saturated $L$-structure then, for each $n\in\posnats$, $\mathfrak{A}$ realises all $n$-types over subsets of finite cardinality.
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	We argue by induction on $n$.  The case $n=1$ follows immediately from the definition of $\aleph_0$-saturation so assume for every $k\leq n$ it holds that $\mathfrak{A}$ realises all $k$-types of $\mathfrak{A}$ over any of its finite subsets.  Let $\Phi(\bar{x})\subseteq L_{n+1}(A_0)$ be an $(n+1)$-type of $\mathfrak{A}$, for some finite $A_0\subseteq A$.  By definition, there must exist an elementary extension $\mathfrak{B}\succcurlyeq\mathfrak{A}$ and some $\bar{b}\in B^{n+1}$ such that $\mathfrak{B}\models\Phi(\bar{b})$.  Now define $\Phi^\prime(x_n)\subseteq L_1(A_0)$ to be the deductive closure of the set
	\begin{equation}
		\setbuild{\exists x_0\dotso\exists x_{n-1}\varphi(x_0,\dotsc,x_n)}{\varphi\in\Phi}.
	\end{equation}

	Supposing that $\bar{b}=(b_0,\dotsc,b_n)$, note that $\mathfrak{B}\models\Phi^\prime(b_n)$ and thus $\Phi^\prime$ is a $1$-type of $\mathfrak{A}$ over $A_0$ and consequently, since $\mathfrak{A}$ is $\aleph_0$-saturated, there exists an $a_n\in A$ such that $\mathfrak{A}\models\Phi^\prime(a_n)$.  Aiming to show that $\Phi(x_0,\dotsc,x_{n-1},a_n)$ is an $n$-type of $\mathfrak{A}$ over $A_1\coloneqq A_0\cup\set{a_n}$, let $\bar{c}$ be an $n$-tuple of constant symbols.  Note that $\Phi(x_0,\dotsc,x_{n-1},a_n)$ is an $n$-type of $\mathfrak{A}$ iff $\Phi(\bar{c},a_n)\cup\Th(\mathfrak{A})$ is a consistent $L(A_1)$-theory.  Also, since $\Phi$ is closed under conjunctions, if $\psi=\psi(x_0,\dotsc,x_n)$ is a finite conjunction of formulas from $\Phi$ then $\psi\in\Phi(\bar{x})$ and thus $\exists x_0\dotso\exists x_{n-1}\psi\in\Phi^\prime(x_n)$.  Therefore, since $\psi$ was arbitrary and $\mathfrak{A}\models\Phi^\prime(a_n)$, it follows that $T\coloneqq\Th(\mathfrak{A})\cup\Phi(\bar{c},a_n)$ is a finitely satisfiable $L(A_1)$-theory so that, by the compactness theorem, $T$ must have an $L(A_1\cup\bar{c})$-model $(\mathfrak{M},\bar{d}\string^a_n)$, for some $L(A_0)$-structure $\mathfrak{M}$ and some $\bar{d}\in M^n$.  By definition it follows that $\mathfrak{M}\succcurlyeq\mathfrak{A}$ is an $L(A_0)$-structure such that $(\mathfrak{M},a_n)\models\Phi(\bar{d}\string^a_n)$.  Therefore, $\Phi(x_0,\dotsc,x_{n-1},a_n)$ is an $n$-type over $A_1$ which, by the induction hypothesis, is realised by some $(a_0,\dotsc,a_{n-1})\in A^n$ and thus if $\bar{a}=(a_0,\dotsc,a_{n-1},a_n)$ then $\mathfrak{A}\models\Phi(\bar{a})$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prp}
	If $\alpha\models\Th(\dense)$
\end{prp}

\begin{prp}
	For any ordinal $\alpha$, if $\mathfrak{A}$ is an $\aleph_\alpha$-saturated $L$-structure then, for each $n\in\posnats$ and any ordinal $\beta<\alpha$, $\mathfrak{A}$ realises all $n$-types over subsets of cardinality $\aleph_\beta$.
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	The case $\alpha=0$ is given by Proposition \ref{prp:sat0}.  Consider now the case $\alpha>0$ and note that if $A_0\subseteq A$ and $\card{A_0}=\aleph_\beta$, for some ordinal $\beta<\alpha$, then it follows that $\card{A_0\cup\set{a}}=\card{A_0}=\aleph_\beta$.  By leveraging this property of infinite cardinals, an induction argument similar to that in the proof of Proposition \ref{prp:sat0} yields the desired result.
\end{proof}

\begin{prp}
	If $\Phi(\bar{x})\subseteq L_n(A)$ is an isolated type of the nonempty $L$-structure $\mathfrak{A}$ then there exists an $\bar{a}\in A^n$ which realises $\Phi$.
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $\Phi(\bar{x})$ is an $n$-type of $\mathfrak{A}$ over $A$, for some $n\in\posnats$.  Since $\Phi$ is isolated, there exists a $\varphi_0\in L_n(A)$ such that $\varphi_0(\bar{x})$ is satisfiable in $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{A}\models\forall\bar{x}(\varphi_0(\bar{x})\rightarrow\varphi(\bar{x}))$ for each $\varphi\in\Phi(\bar{x})$.  By definition, there must exist some $\bar{a}\in A^n$ such that $\mathfrak{A}\models\varphi_0(\bar{a})$.  Consequently, it follows from the definition of $\varphi_0$ that $\mathfrak{A}\models\Phi(\bar{a})$, as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}[Atomicity]
	An $L$-structure $\mathfrak{A}$ is called \textbf{atomic} whenever the only types over $\emptyset$ which are realised in $\mathfrak{A}$ are isolated.
\end{dfn}


\section{Games on structures}

In what follows we will describe, for some arbitrary ordinal $\gamma$, the \textbf{Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e game} $\EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$ of length $\gamma$ on $L$-structures $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$.  In this game there are two players $\Left$ and $\Right$ (respectively pronounced ``Left'' and ``Right'').  This first move of the game is always made by $\Left$ and consists of some choice of element from either one of the structures $\mathfrak{A}$ or $\mathfrak{B}$.  The players alternate turns and on each of  $\Right$'s turns he is obliged to choose an element from the opposing structure i.e.\ from $\mathfrak{B}$ if $\Left$'s last move was an element in $\mathfrak{A}$ or vice-versa.

\begin{dfn}[Position]
	A pair $(\bar{a},\bar{b})$, consisting of transfinite sequences $\bar{a}=\family{a_i}{i<\gamma}$ and $\bar{b}=\family{b_i}{i<\gamma}$, is called a \textbf{position} of the game $\EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$ whenever, for each $i<\gamma$, $a_i\in\domain{}\mathfrak{A}$ and $b_i\in\domain{}\mathfrak{B}$ are the elements played during the $i$-th round of the game $\EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$.  We refer to $\gamma$ as the \textit{length} of the position.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Play]
	A \textbf{play} in the game $\EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$ is any maximal position in the game.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Winning play]
	A position $(\bar{a},\bar{b})$ of the game $\EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$ is said to be \textbf{a winning play for} $\bm{\mathcal{R}}$ iff there exists some isomorphism $f\colon\gen{\bar{a}}{\mathfrak{A}}\to\gen{\bar{b}}{\mathfrak{B}}$ such that $f[\bar{a}]=f[\bar{b}]$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Back-and-forth equivalence]
	We define $\mathfrak{A}\sim_\gamma\mathfrak{B}$ for an ordinal $\gamma$ if there exists a winning strategy for $\Right$ in the game $\EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$.  For the special case $\gamma=\omega$: if $\mathfrak{A}\sim_\omega\mathfrak{B}$ then it is said that $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are \textbf{back-and-forth equivalent}.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Winning position]
	In the back-and-forth game $\EF_\omega(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$ a position $(\bar{c},\bar{d})$ of length $n\in\nats$ is called a $\textbf{winning position}$ for a particular player if whenever that player can win the $\EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$ when starting from position $(\bar{c},\bar{d})$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prp}\label{prp:bfiso}
	Suppose $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are countable $L$-structures, for some language $L$, and let $(\bar{c},\bar{d})$ be a winning position for $\Right$ in $\EF_\omega(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$.  If $\mathfrak{A}\sim_\omega\mathfrak{B}$ then there exists an isomorphism $f\colon\mathfrak{A}\to\mathfrak{B}$ such that $f[\bar{c}]=f[\bar{d}]$ i.e.\ an isomorphism $f\colon(\mathfrak{A},\bar{c})\to(\mathfrak{B},\bar{d})$.
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\bar{a}=\family{a_i}{i<\omega}$ and $\bar{a}=\family{a_i}{i<\omega}$, respectively, be enumerations of the structures $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$.  In what follows we describe the remainder of the game $\EF_\omega(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B}$.  On every odd round $\Left$ plays the first element occuring in $\bar{a}$ which he has not played at any previous position of the game and does not occur in $\bar{c}$.  Similarly, on every even round $\Left$ plays the first element occuring in $\bar{b}$ which he has not played at a previous position of the game and does not occur in $\bar{d}$.  Naturally, $\Right$ simply responds using his winning strategy on every round.

	Note, given any element from either one of the two structures, that $\Left$ will play that element after finitely many rounds.  Hence all the elements from both $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ make an appearance at some point in the game.  By definition of a winning play, there then exists an isomorphism $f\colon\gen{\bar{c}\string^\bar{a}}{\mathfrak{A}}\to\gen{\bar{d}\string^\bar{b}}{\mathfrak{B}}$ such that $f[\bar{c}\string^\bar{a}]=f[\bar{d}\string^\bar{b}]$ and hence $f[\bar{c}]=f[\bar{d}]$.  Since $\gen{\bar{a}}{\mathfrak{A}}=\mathfrak{A}$ and $\gen{\bar{b}}{\mathfrak{B}}=\mathfrak{B}$, the result follows as intended.
\end{proof}


\section{Interpretations}

\begin{dfn}[(Un)nested term]
	If $L$ is any language and $t$ is an $L$-term then $t$ is said to be \textbf{unnested} whenever $t$ one of the following holds:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$t$ is a variable $x$,
		\item	$t$ is a constant symbol $c$,
		\item	or, for some $n\in\posnats$, there exists an $n$-ary function symbol $f$ in $L$ and an $n$-tuple $\bar{x}$ of variables such that $t=t(\bar{x})$ is of the form $f(\bar{x})$.
	\end{enumerate}
	A term which is not unnested is (unsurprisingly) referred to as being \textbf{nested}.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Unnested atomic formula]
	An \textit{atomic} $L$-formula $\varphi$ is said to be \textbf{unnested} provided that $\varphi$ is either of the form $s=t$, for some unnested $L$-terms $s$ and $t$, or there exists a $n\in\posnats$, an $n$-ary relation symbol $R$ and an $n$-tuple $\bar{x}$ of variables such that $\varphi=\varphi(\bar{x})$ is $R(\bar{x})$.

\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[(Un)nested formula]
	An arbitrary formula $\varphi$ is called \textbf{unnested} whenever each of its atomic subformulas is unnested.  A \textbf{nested formula} is then simply a formula which is not unnested.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Substitutability of terms]
	Suppose $\varphi=\varphi(\bar{x},y)$ is an $L$-formula and $t=t(\bar{v})$ is any $L$-term such that $\bar{v}=(v_0,\dotsc,v_k)$.  We say that $t$ is \textbf{substitutable} for $y$ in $\varphi$ iff no instance of a variable $v_i$ in $t$ (for $i<k$) is bound by a quantifier in $\varphi(\bar{x},t/y)$.  In other words, no free instance of $y$ in $\varphi(\bar{x},y)$ lies in the scope of some $\exists v_i$ (hence also $\forall v_i$) such that $i<k$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Substitutability]
	Suppose $\varphi=\varphi(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ is an $L$-formula and, for some $n\in\nats$, $\bar{y}$ has length $n$ and $\bar{t}$ is an $n$-tuple of terms.  We say that $\bar{t}$ is \textbf{substitutable} for $\bar{y}$ in $\varphi$ whenever, for each $i<n$, $t_i$ is substitutable for $y_i$ in $\varphi$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Interpretation]
	Suppose $L$ and $L^\prime$ are first-order languages, fix an enumeration $\family{x_i}{i<\omega}$ of the set of variables $V$ and, for each $i<\omega$, let $\bar{x}_i$ denote the $n$-tuple $\left(x_i,\dotsc,x_{i+(n-1)}\right)$.  If $\Gamma\colon L\to L^\prime$ is a map and $\del_\Gamma\coloneqq\Gamma(\exists x_1(x_0=x_1))$ then $\Gamma$ is called an $\mathbf{n}$\textbf{-dimensional interpretation} of $L$ in $L^\prime$ whenever the following holds:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	for every $k\in\nats$, if $\varphi=\varphi(x_0,\dotsc,x_{k-1})$ then
			\begin{equation}
				\Gamma(\varphi)=\Gamma(\varphi)(\bar{x}_0,\dotsc,\bar{x}_{k-1}),
			\end{equation}
			i.e\ the free variables of $\Gamma(\varphi)$ are among the components of $\bar{x}_0,\dotsc,\bar{x}_{k-1}$,
		\item	$\Gamma(\bot)=\bot$,
		\item	$\Gamma(\varphi\wedge\psi)=\Gamma(\varphi)\wedge\Gamma(\psi)$,
		\item	$\Gamma(\varphi\rightarrow\psi)=\Gamma(\varphi)\rightarrow\Gamma(\psi)$,
		\item	if $k\in\nats$ and $\varphi=\varphi(x_0,\dotsc,x_{k+1})$ then it necessarily follows that $\Gamma(\exists x_{k+1}\varphi)$ is the formula
			\begin{equation}
				\exists\bar{x}_{k+1}\left(\del_\Gamma(\bar{x}_{k+1}/\bar{x}_0)\wedge\Gamma(\varphi)\right),
			\end{equation}
		\item	for each $n\in\nats$ and every $\bar{x},\bar{x}^\prime\in V^n$: if $\varphi=\varphi(\bar{x})$, $\bar{x}^\prime$ is substitutable for $\bar{x}$ in $\varphi$ and $\psi=\varphi(\bar{x}^\prime/\bar{x})$ then it follows that $\Gamma(\psi)$ is is obtainable from $\Gamma(\varphi)$ by a change of variables.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}

It should be empasised that the first clause in the preceding definition merely exists for convenience: simplifying the task of keeping track of free variables accross interpretations.  The final clause on the other hand is to guarantee that formulas which differ only in their choice of free variables remain as such when taking their respecitve images under $\Gamma$.  The remaining clauses server to preserve the syntactic structure of formulas under $\Gamma$.  Those familiar with algebraic logic will recognise that $\Gamma$, in an obvious manner, gives rise to homomorphism of cylindrical algebras.  For the rest of us, $\Gamma$ merely acts as a ``translator'' of formulas in $L$ to formulas in $L^\prime$.

A model theorist, however, is far more concerned with theories and models than formal languages for their own sake.  Fortunately, interpretations can serve a purpose that the model theorist would find pleasing.  We refer to the ability of reducing truth of sentences in the presence of a theory to truth of their interpretation in a more appropriate or better understood theory.

\begin{dfn}[Interpration of theories]
	Suppose $L$ and $L^\prime$ are first-order languages.  If $T$ is an $L$-theory and $T^\prime$ is an $L^\prime$-theory then an \textbf{interpretation of }$\bm{T}$\textbf{ in }$\bm{T^\prime}$ is an interpretation $\Gamma$ of $L$ in $L^\prime$ such that, for every sentence $\sigma$ in $L$,
	\begin{equation}
		T\models\sigma\quad\implies\quad T^\prime\models\Gamma(\sigma).
	\end{equation}
\end{dfn}

\begin{prp}
	Suppose $T$ is an $L$-theory and $T^\prime$ is an $L^\prime$-theory and let $\Gamma$ be an interpretation of $T$ in $T^\prime$.  If $T$ is complete then, for every $L$-sentence $\sigma$,
	\begin{equation}
		T^\prime\models\Gamma(\sigma)\quad\implies\quad T\models\sigma
	\end{equation}
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	Assume to the contrary that $T^\prime\not\models\Gamma(\sigma)$ but $T\models\sigma$.  Since $T$ is complete it immediately follows that $T\models\neg\sigma$ and thus, by definition of $\Gamma$, we may conclude that $T^\prime\models\Gamma(\sigma)$ --- which is the desired contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}[Interpretation of structures]
	Let $L$ and $L^\prime$ be first-order languages and suppose that $\mathfrak{A}$ is an $L$-structure and $\mathfrak{B}$ is an $L^\prime$-structure.  If $\Gamma$ is an $n$-dimensional ($n\in\nats$) interpretation of $L^\prime$ in $L$ and $f\colon\del_\Gamma(A^n)\to B$ is a surjection then we call the pair $(\Gamma,f)$ an \textbf{interpration of }$\bm{\mathfrak{B}}$\textbf{ in }$\bm{\mathfrak{A}}$ whenever it holds for every unnested atomic formula $\varphi\in L^\prime_k$ and each $\bar{a}_i\in A^n$ ($i<k$) that
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{B}\models\varphi(f(\bar{a}_0),\dotsc,f(\bar{a}_{k-1}))\quad\iff\quad\mathfrak{A}\models\Gamma(\varphi)(\bar{a}_0,\dotsc,\bar{a}_{k-1}).
	\end{equation}
\end{dfn}

Having introduced a third concept sharing the common name of ``interpration'' we would like them all be related in some manner.  As the connection between the first two should be clear we now turn our attention towards interpretation of structures.

\begin{prp}\label{prp:unnest}
	If $L$ is a first-order language then, for each atomic $\varphi\in L$, there exists an unnested $\E{1}$-formula $\varphi^\exists$ and an unnested $\A{1}$-formula $\varphi^\forall$ such that $\varphi$ is logically equivalent to $\varphi^\exists$ as well as $\varphi^\forall$.
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $\varphi$ is atomic and argue by induction on the maximum number of nested function symbols in $\varphi$.  The base case (i.e.\ when no function symbols occur in $\varphi$) follows from the fact that atomic formulas are simultaneously also $\A{1}$-formulas and $\E{1}$-formulas.

	Suppose, for some $n\in\nats$, the result holds whenever the maximum number of nested function symbols in $\varphi$ is $k<n$.  Suppose now that $\varphi$ has at most $n$ nested occurences of any function symbol in $L$.
	\begin{case}
		$\varphi$ is $s=t$ for some $L$-terms $s$ and $t$.
	\end{case}
	\begin{proof}
		Consider the case where $s$ is of the form $f(s_0,\dotsc,s_{m-1})$, for $L$-terms $s_0,\dotsc,s_{m-1}$, and $t$ is the variable $x$.  Let $\bar{y}$ be an $m$-tuple of variables then it follows that $\varphi$ is logically equivalent to the $\E{1}$-formula
		\begin{equation}
			\exists\bar{y}\left(\left(\bigwedge_{i<m}y_i=s_i\right)\wedge f(\bar{y})=x\right),
		\end{equation}
		which has at most $n$ nested occurences of any function symbol belonging to $L$.  In a similar fashion $\varphi$ is also logically equivalent to the $\A{1}$-formula
		\begin{equation}
			\forall\bar{y}\left(\left(\bigwedge_{i<m}y_i=s_i\right)\rightarrow f(\bar{y})=x\right),
		\end{equation}
		which also has at most $n$ nested occurences of any function symbol.  One may now apply the induction hypothesis and the remaining cases will follow similarly.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{case}
		There exists a relation symbol $r$ in $L$, having arity $m\in\nats$, and $L$-terms $t_0,\dotsc,t_{m-1}$ such that $\varphi$ is $r(t_0,\dotsc,t_{m-1})$.
	\end{case}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $\bar{y}$ be an $m$-tuple of variables.  The formula $\varphi$ must necessarily be logically equivalent to the $\E{1}$-formula
		\begin{equation}
			\exists\bar{y}\left(\left(\bigwedge_{i<m}y_i=t_i\right)\wedge r(y_0,\dotsc,y_{m-1})\right),
		\end{equation}
		as well as the $\A{1}$-formula
		\begin{equation}
			\forall\bar{y}\left(\left(\bigwedge_{i<m}y_i=t_i\right)\rightarrow r(y_0,\dotsc,y_{m-1})\right),
		\end{equation}
		both of which can have no more than $n$ nested occurences of any function symbol in $L$.  Now applying the induction hypothesis yields the desired result.
	\end{proof}
	The result has thus been proven for all atomic $\varphi$ belonging to $L$, concluding the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:unnest}
	If $\varphi$ is any $L$-formula then there exists an unnested $L$-formula $\psi$ which is logically equivalent to $\varphi$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	Leveraging Proposition \ref{prp:unnest}, we may replace all unnested atomic subformulas of $\varphi$ with unnested eqvuivalents in order to obtain a new formula $\varphi^\prime$.  As no atomic subformula of $\varphi^\prime$ is nested, and $\varphi^\prime$ is certainly logically equivalent to $\varphi$, the result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{prp}\label{prp:strint}
	If $(\Gamma,f)$ is an $n$-dimensional interpretation of the $L^\prime$-structure $\mathfrak{B}$ in the $L$-structure $\mathfrak{A}$ and $k\in\nats$ then, for every $\varphi\in L^\prime_k$ and each $\bar{a}_0,\dotsc,\bar{a}_{k-1}\in A^n$, it follows that
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{B}\models\varphi(f(\bar{a}_0),\dotsc,f(\bar{a}_{k-1}))\quad\iff\quad\mathfrak{A}\models\Gamma(\varphi)(\bar{a}_0,\dotsc,\bar{a}_{k-1})\label{eq:interp}
	\end{equation}
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	Observe that a formula is unnested iff each of its subformulas are unnested.  Additionally, \ref{cor:unnest} tells us we need only concern ourselves with unnested formulas.  Employing these facts, we now argue by induction on the complexity of formulas that \ref{eq:interp} holds whenever $\varphi$ is unnested.

	The atomic case is trivial as per the definition of an interpretation of structures.  Suppose now that $\varphi,\psi\in L$ satisfy \ref{eq:interp}.  Note that we may assume $\varphi,\psi\in L_k$, for some $k\in\nats$:  if $y$ is any variable which has an occurence in $\psi$ but not in $\varphi=\varphi(\bar{x})$ then $\varphi$ is logically equivalent to $\varphi(\bar{x})\wedge y=y$.  If $\varphi\wedge\psi$ is unnested then it follows that both $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are (respectively) unnested and, thus, from the inductive hypothesis and the Tarski definition of $\models$ it must hold, for every $\bar{a}_0,\dotsc,\bar{a}_k\in A^n$, that
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{B}\models(\varphi\wedge\psi)(f(\bar{a}_0),\dotsc,f(\bar{a}_k))\quad\iff\quad\mathfrak{A}\models\Gamma(\varphi\wedge\psi)(\bar{a}_0,\dotsc,\bar{a}_k).
	\end{equation}
	Similarly, it can be shown that if $\varphi\rightarrow\psi$ is unnested then
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{B}\models(\varphi\rightarrow\psi)(f(\bar{a}_0),\dotsc,f(\bar{a}_k))\quad\iff\quad\mathfrak{A}\models\Gamma(\varphi\rightarrow\psi)(\bar{a}_0,\dotsc,\bar{a}_k).
	\end{equation}
	 Suppose now that $\varphi=\varphi(\bar{x},y)$, for some $(k-1)$-tuple of variables $\bar{x}$, and that $\exists y\varphi(\bar{x},y)$ is unnested then it follows that $\varphi$ is unnested.  If $\bar{b}\in B^{k-1}$ and $\mathfrak{B}\models\exists y\varphi(\bar{x},y)$ then there exists a $d\in B$ such that
	 \begin{equation}
		 \mathfrak{B}\models\varphi(\bar{b},d).
	 \end{equation}
	 Since $f$ is a surjection there exists $\bar{a}_0,\dotsc,\bar{a}_{k-2},\bar{c}\in A^n$ such that $f(\bar{c})=d$ and $f(\bar{a}_i)=b_i$, for $i<n$.  From the definition of $\varphi$ it then follows that
	 \begin{equation}
		 \mathfrak{A}\models\Gamma(\varphi)(\bar{a}_0,\dotsc,\bar{a}_{k-2},\bar{c}),
	 \end{equation}
	 and thus we may conclude
	 \begin{equation}
		 \mathfrak{A}\models\exists\bar{y}\Gamma(\varphi)(\bar{a}_0,\dotsc,\bar{a}_{k-2},\bar{y}).\label{eq:exint}
	 \end{equation}
	 The converse is even simpler:  start from (\ref{eq:exint}) and take the image under $f$ of the initial tuples in $A^n$ as well as the tuple acting in the role of $\bar{c}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
	If $(\Gamma,f)$ is an interpretation of the structure $\mathfrak{B}$ in the structure $\mathfrak{A}$ then it follows that $\Gamma$ is an interpretation of $\Th(\mathfrak{B})$ in $\Th(\mathfrak{A})$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	Obtained as a special case from Proposition \ref{prp:strint} by considering sentences only.
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}[Definitional expansion]
	Suppose $\mathfrak{A}$ is an $L$-structure and let $L^\prime\supseteq L$.  We call an $L^\prime$-structure $\mathfrak{A}^\prime$ a \textbf{definitional expansion} of $\mathfrak{A}$ whenever the following holds:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$A=A^\prime$,
		\item	for each constant symbold $c$ belonging to $L^\prime\setminus L$, there exists an $L$-formula $\varphi\in L_1$ such that, for every $a\in A$,
			\begin{equation}
				\mathfrak{A}\models\varphi(a)\quad\iff\quad a=c^{\mathfrak{A}^\prime},
			\end{equation}
		\item	for each $n\in\nats$ and every $(n+1)$-ary function symbol $f$ belonging to $L^\prime\setminus L$ there exists an $L$-formula $\varphi=\varphi(\bar{x},y)$ such that $\varphi\in L_{n+1}$ and, for every $\bar{a}\in A^n$ and $b\in A$,
			\begin{equation}
				\mathfrak{A}\models\varphi(\bar{a},b)\quad\iff\quad f^{\mathfrak{A}^\prime}(\bar{a})=b,
			\end{equation}
		\item	for each $n\in\posnats$ and every $n$-ary relation symbol $r$ belonging to $L^\prime\setminus L$ there exists an $L$-formula $\varphi=\varphi(\bar{x})$ such that $\varphi\in L_n$ and, for each $\bar{a}\in A^n$,
			\begin{equation}
				\mathfrak{A}\models r(\bar{a})\quad\iff\quad r^{\mathfrak{A}^\prime}(\bar{a}).
			\end{equation}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Recursively enumerable theory]
	If $L$ is a countable first-order language and $T$ is an $L$-theory then we refer to $T$ as being \textbf{recursively enumerable} whenever $\dcl{T}$ is a recursively enumerable set.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Regular expansion]
	Suppose $\mathfrak{A}$ is an $L$-structure and let $L^\prime\supseteq L$.  If the signature $L^\prime$ is obtained from $L$ by adding finitely many additional relation symbols and the $L^\prime$-structure $\mathfrak{A}^\prime$ satisfies $A=A^\prime$ then $\mathfrak{A}^\prime$ is said to be a \textbf{regular expansion} of $\mathfrak{A}$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Proof sequence]
	Suppose $L$ is a finitary first-order language and let $T$ be a recursively enumerable $L$-theory.  If $\mathcal{A}$ is a recursively enumerable class of regular expansions of models of $T$ then a \textbf{proof sequence} over $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite sequence of pairs $(\mathfrak{M}_0,\sigma_0),\dotsc,(\mathfrak{M}_{n-1},\sigma_{n-1})$ such that, for each $i<n$, $\mathfrak{M}_i\in\mathcal{A}$ and one of the following holds:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$\sigma_i$ is a logical axiom,
		\item	$\sigma_i\in T$,
		\item	$\sigma_i$ follows via an inference rule from $\setbuild{\sigma_j}{j<i}$,
		\item	$i>0$ and, for some $j<i$, there exists an interpretation $\Gamma$ of $\mathfrak{M}_j$ in $\mathfrak{M}_i$ such that $\sigma_i=\Gamma(\sigma_j)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}


\section{Linear orders and coloured expansions}

Note that, from this section onwards, $L$ will exclusively denote the \textit{language of partial orders} i.e.\ the language whose signature consists of only the binary relation symbol $<$.


\begin{dfn}[Dense linear order]
	A linear order $\alpha$ is called \textbf{dense} whenever, for every $a,b\in\alpha$, there exists $a\in\alpha$ such that $a<c<b$.  Additionally, $\alpha$ is said to be \textit{trivially dense} if the order type of alpha is either $\zero$ or $\one$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Coloured linear order]
	If $\alpha$ is a linear order and $\bar{r}$ is a (finite) tuple $(r_0,\dotsc,r_{k-1})$ of unary relations on $\alpha$ then the expansion $(\alpha,\bar{r})$ is said to be a $\mathbf{k}$\textbf{-coloured linear order}.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Spectrum]
	Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ is a class of $k$-coloured linear orders.  We call $F$ an $\mathbf{n}$\textbf{-spectrum} for the class $\mathcal{A}$ when $F$ is a minimal set of linear orders with the property that for every $\alpha\in\mathcal{A}$ there exists a $\chi\in F$ such that $\alpha\nequiv{n}\chi$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Spectrum of sentences]
	Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ is a class of $k$-coloured linear orders and $F$ is an $n$-spectrum for $\mathcal{A}$.  If $\Sigma$ is a set of sentences (in the language of coloured linear orders) such that $\card{\Sigma}=\card{F}$ and, for each $\alpha\in F$, there exists a unique $\sigma_\alpha\in\Sigma$ such that $\alpha\models\sigma_\alpha$ then $\Sigma$ is called an $\mathbf{n}$\textbf{-spectrum} for $\Th(\mathcal{A})$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{lem}[Splitting Lemma]\label{lem:split}
	Suppose $\alpha$ and $\beta$ linear orders and fix any $n\in\posnats$ then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$\alpha\nequiv{n}\beta$,
		\item	\begin{enumerate}
				\item	for every $a\in\alpha$ there exists a $b\in\beta$ such that $\alpha^{<a}\nequiv{n-1}\beta^{<b}$ and $\alpha^{>a}\nequiv{n-1}\beta^{>b}$, and also,
				\item	for every $b\in\beta$ there exists an $a\in\alpha$ such that $\alpha^{<a}\nequiv{n-1}\beta^{<b}$ and $\alpha^{>a}\nequiv{n-1}\beta^{>b}$.
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	\noindent(1)$\Rightarrow$(2):\quad 	Suppse $\alpha\nequiv{n}\beta$ and fix any $a\in\alpha$.  By considering $a$ as the first move of player $\Left$ in the game $\EF_n(\alpha,\beta)$, $\Right$ uses his winning strategy to play some $b\in\beta$.
\end{proof}


\section{Basic operations on linear orders}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:fvsum}
	Suppose $\family{\alpha_i}{i\in I}$ and $\family{\beta}{i\in I}$ are families of (possibly coloured) linear orders, indexed by a linearly ordered set $I\neq\emptyset$.  Now fix some $n\in\nats$ and assume $\alpha_i\nequiv{n}\beta_i$, for each $i\in J$, then it follows that
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{i\in I}\alpha_i\nequiv{n}\sum_{i\in I}\beta_i.
	\end{equation}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	We describe the winning strategy for the relevant $n$-game, namely
	\begin{equation}
		\EF_n\left(\sum_{i\in I}\alpha,\sum_{i\in I}\beta\right).
	\end{equation}

	For any $k<n$, if $\Left$ chose his $k$-th move to be $a_{k-1}\in\alpha_i$, for some $i\in I$, the player $\Right$ chooses his move $b_{k-1}$ such that $b_{k-1}\in\beta_i$ by applying his winning strategy for the $n$-round game between $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$.

	A move $b_{k-1}\in\beta_j$ by $\Left$ is countered by $\Right$ in a similar fashion.  This now establishes the result.
\end{proof}

\begin{prp}
	If $\beta\models\Th(\omega)$ then there exists a linear order $\alpha$ such that $\beta\cong\omega+\zeta\cdot\alpha$.
\end{prp}

\begin{prp}\label{prp:omega}
	The first-order theory $\Th(\omega)$ is finitely axiomatisable.
\end{prp}
\begin{proof}
	Let $T$ denote the first-order theory consisting of only the sentences:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$\axmlin$,
		\item	$\exists x\forall y(x\neq y\rightarrow x<y)$,
		\item	$\forall x\exists y(x<y\wedge\neg\exists z(x<z<y))$,
		\item	$\forall x\big(\exists y(y<x)\rightarrow\exists y(y<x\wedge\neg\exists z(y<z<x))\big)$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Together these express (in order) that if $\alpha$ is a model of $T$ then:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$\alpha$ is a linear order,
		\item	$\alpha$ has a least element,
		\item	every element of $\alpha$ has an immediate successor,
		\item	every non-minimal element of $\alpha$ has an immediate predecessor.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


\section{Lattices}

\begin{thm}[Knaster-Tarski Theorem]
	Suppose $\Lambda$ is a complete lattices.  If $h$ is some endomorphism on $\Lambda$ then there must exist a (least) $x_0\in \Lambda$ such that $x_0$ is a fix0ed point of $h$, i.e.\ $h(x_0)=x_0$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	We start by exhibiting a fixed point of $h$.  Since $\Lambda$ is nonempty there exists a top $1\in\Lambda$, since by completeness, taking the join of $\Lambda$ we get an element $1=\bigvee\Lambda$.  Since $h$ is isotone we may conclude that $h(1)=1$.

	We are now obligated to find a least fixed point of $h$ so define
	\begin{equation}
		S=\setbuild{x\in\Lambda}{h(x)=x}
	\end{equation}  then clearly $S\neq\emptyset$ since $1\in S$.  Define $x_0=\bigwedge S$ and note that, since $x_0\leq x$ for each $x\in S$, by definition of isotonicity it follows that $h(x_0)\leq x$, for $x\in S$. Therefore $h(x_0)\leq\bigwedge S=x_0$.  Consequently, since $h(x_0)$ is a lower bound of $S$.  Since $x_0$ is the infimum of $S$ we cannot have $h(x_0)<x_0$.  Thus the only remaining possibility is $h(x_0)=x_0$, implying that $x\in S$.
\end{proof}

\section{Decidability}

	\begin{prp}
		If $\Sigma$ is a set of $L$-sentences then $\Sigma$ is decidable set of sentences iff $\Sigma$ and $L_0\setminus\Sigma$, each, are recursively enumerable.
	\end{prp}

	\begin{prp}\label{prp:sdth}
		Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ is a class of structures.  If $\Sigma$ is a recursively enumerable set of sentences and its deductive closure $\dcl{\Sigma}$ satisfies
		\begin{equation}
			\dcl{\Sigma}=\Th(\mathcal{A}),
		\end{equation}
		then $\Th(\mathcal{A})$ is recursively enumerable.
	\end{prp}

	\begin{dfn}[Encoding]
		An \textbf{encoding} $p$ of a countable set $X$ is an injective recursive partial function $p\colon X\pto\nats$.  If $X$ is a first order language then $p$ is in stead referred to as a \textit{G\"odel numbering}.
	\end{dfn}

	\begin{dfn}[Frameworks]
		Suppose for some $A\subseteq X$, where $X$ is of (coloured) linear orders, there exists a family $\family{\Gamma_{alpha,\beta}}{(\alpha,\beta)\in A\times X}$
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item	$p\colon X\to\nats$ is an encoding of the (countable) set of coloured linear orders,
			\item 	the binary relation $\preceq$ is a well-founded preorder defined on $X$,
			\item	the map $\rho\colon X\to\nats$ is the rank function associated with $(X,\preceq)$.  If, for each $x,y\in X$, it holds that
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{dfn}

	\begin{dfn}[Proof sequences]
		Suppose $X$ is a countable set of countable coloured linear orders and let $p\colon X\pto\nats$ be an encoding of $X$.  A \textbf{proof sequence} is then a finite sequence
		\begin{equation}
			(\alpha_0,\sigma_0),\dotsc,(\alpha_{n-1},\sigma_{n-1})\in X\times L_0
		\end{equation}
		and finite expansions $\alpha^\prime_0,\dotsc,\alpha^\prime_{n-1}$ of the (respective) linear orders $\alpha_0,\dotsc,\alpha_{n-1}$ so that, for each $i=1,\dotsc,n-1$, there exists an interpretation $\Gamma_i$ of $\alpha_{i-1}$ in $\alpha^\prime_i$.  Additionally, when $0\leq i<n$, we require that one of the following holds:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item	$\sigma_i$ is a logical axiom,
			\item	$\sigma_i$ follows via an inference rule from $\sigma_0,\dotsc,\sigma_{i-1}$,
			\item	$\sigma_i\in\admis(\Gamma_i)$ or
			\item	$\sigma_i=\Gamma_i\Gamma_{i-1}\dotsb\Gamma_j\sigma_j$, for some natural $j<i$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{dfn}
